Version 1.7
- Changed scheme for generating makefile dependencies, no longer requires makedepend
- Fixed a memory leak in cry_fort.cc
- Revised the data file coefficient for the low-energy cutoff from 15400.0 to
  14800.0 to match value in references: Cooke 1983 and Dorman 2009, see cry.pdf.
- Modified a number of source files to assure there are no compiler warning
  messages
- Modified some make and source files (added includes) to provide compatibility
  with Ubuntu Linux
- Made Geant example program compatible with Geant4.9.5

Version 1.6
- Fixed error in CRYGenerator.cc that resulted in non-flat XY distribution
- Changed latDist in data files to specify range (-1.,1.) to avoid confusion
  since the range is automatically reset to match the box size inside the code
- Updated geant4 build example to explicitly link static library 
   (geant4.9.3 switched to dynamic library by default)
- Fixed error in Source.F (mcnpx/mcnp only) which resulted in missing or duplicate 
  cosmic-ray particles for shower multiplicity > 1 (about 7% of the time)

Version 1.5
 - Fixed SolarMin/Max calculation, min and max were swapped.

 - Update of MCNP/MCNPX examples with common master source to generate both
 - Reference output for Geant4

Version 1.3
