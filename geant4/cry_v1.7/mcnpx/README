Directions for MCNPX build with CRY library
(tested with v2.5.0 and v2.6b)

(0) Build mcnpx from source code

(1) Download and install 'libCRY.a'

(2) Copy source.F to /path_to_mcnpx/src/mcnpx/mcnpf

(3) Append the following line to /path_to_mcnpx/src/mcnpx/Makefile.h

    XLIBS := ${XLIBS} -L/path_to_CRY_library -lCRY  -lstdc++ 

(4) Rebuild mcnpx with 'make install'

---------------------------------------------------
Directions for running MCNPX with CRY library :

(1) Create 'setup.file' to specify CRY parameters.
    At run time mcnpx will look for this file in the current directory. 
    User can set environment variable CRYSETUPPATH to look for this
    file in another directory

(2) Set environment variable CRYDATAPATH to point to CRY input data

(3) Add users data cards (IDUM and RDUM) to your input deck to specify the cell in which 
    to start cosmic rays and the height (z position) within the cell. 
    Note that cry produces cosmic rays coming through a square "patch" of sky.

    IDUM n      $ cell=n in which to start cosmic rays
    rdum z      $ height=z (cm) inside cell to start cosmic rays

Example files:
  inp_cry
  setup.file

mcnpx inp=inp_cry
